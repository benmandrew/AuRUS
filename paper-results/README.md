> ## Reading the Results
>
> You can download the results of our experimental evaluation from this link: Results.zip. 
>
> We ran the algorithm 10 times for each case study. All the results that we obtained are reported in the result section.
>
> You can use script read-results.sh to extract a summary of results for each run.
>
> Example:
>
> ./read-results.sh result/result-70-10-20/arbiter/arbiter-genuine
>
> This command will show the results obtained for the Arbiter case study in the 10 runs with a configuration in which .7 was assigned to the realisability property, 0.1 to the syntactic distance, and .2 to the semantic distance.
